# MSE 641 - Clickbait Detection Challenge

This repository contains the code for the MSE 641 project, focusing on the Clickbait Detection Challenge. The project involves two main tasks: spoiler type classification and spoiler generation.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two distinct tasks based on the SemEval 2023 Clickbait Spoiling challenge:

1.  **Task 1: Spoiler Type Classification**
    -   **Objective**: To classify a given clickbait post into one of three spoiler categories: `phrase`, `passage`, or `multi`.
    -   **Evaluation Metric**: Weighted F1-Score.

2.  **Task 2: Spoiler Generation**
    -   **Objective**: To generate a short, concise text that spoils the clickbait content, satisfying the curiosity induced by the post.
